Containerized view
==================

Usecase: limit view of container, 'df -h' numbers will show only space
provided by quota

Implementation:

btrfs_statfs will decide which way to report the numbers, either
full-filesystem (no change) or numbers trimmed by quota.

This requires an external hint that is attached to the subvolume, eg. a mount
option.

statfs gets a dentry, look up the root, request quota limits, print the
numbers.

Compatibility: default must not change, ie. full filesystem report by default
