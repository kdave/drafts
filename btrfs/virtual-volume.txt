Virtual filesystem volume
=========================

Provide a thin virtual volume that would be logically encapsulate all devices
in the filesystem.

This would allow to remove any device from the filesystem, currently it's not
possible to remove the device from which the filesystem is mounted without
consequences. Eg. the VFS does not allow to replace the device entry for the
filesystem.

The virtual device could be accessed directly, redirecting all the reads to
specific devices, although the mapping could be 1:N for the redundancy raid
profiles. Direct writes are not necessary, possibly only for testing purposes.

The virtual size of the device may or may not reflect the actual filesystem
size. The internal logical offsets increase in time and will exceed the size,
so the virtual device would need to update it's size, or report some fake
value. As far as the virtual size reflects something sensible, the reads and
writes may be implemented, otherwise not.
