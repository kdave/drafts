Tree block search ioctl
-----------------------

Search a tree block according intersecting a key range. Purpose is mainly for
debugging, maybe for some statistics and curious apps.

* fill buffer only with items from one single block
* advance the key for next round
* fill other metadata of the block

the purpose is to get to the btrfs_header:
* fsid (not really necessary)
* checksum
* address
* generation
* owner (subvolid)
* nritems
* level

intentionally left out:
* chunk tree uuid

- questions

add a way to go to the non-leaf nodes? ie. add range for the levels
