Status: implemented

fs-verity notes
---------------

Q: lots of new items and compatibility issues

- requires compatibility bit, per inode
  => expensive? must be? better options?
  - ro-compat (yes)
  - rw-compat (no)

- orphan inodes
  - typed orphan, with stranded merkle tree

- encrypt merkle tree, per file, new item required

- container format
