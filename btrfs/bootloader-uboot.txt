U-Boot bootloader btrfs audit
-----------------------------

Probably based on userspace code of btrfs-progs from 2017.

Features
- zlib, lzo, zstd
- file lookup, read
- checksums:
  - only crc32c implemented
  - superblock checked, not data or metadata

Not implemented
- multiple devices, thus no raid redundancy etc

Non-issues same as for GRUB (free space, file lookups, dir listing)

Issues

- 3 copies of superblock (1 extra)
- lzo decompression has the bug with not skipping last bytes when chunk starts
  at last 4 bytes in a page
- not enough sanity checks for on-disk structures
