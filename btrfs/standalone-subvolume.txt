Standalone subvolume
--------------------

Goal: make subvolumes more independent, preserve some of the features

Introduce new type of subvolume: attach own extent tree to it

* a snapshot will share extents in that tree, and only there
* reflink works only within the subvolumes of the same extent tree
* the extent tree will have random tree id
* the extent tree must be resolved with respect to the owning fstree
* (unsure) the extent tree shares id with the rest
  it must be easy to determine extent tree of a fstree, one lookup at most

Feature change:
* add some flexibility and containment
* can be used to encrypt subvolumes independently and preserve snapshotting
* quotas apply only to the extent group -- that can be very tricky in the end
* relocation should be able to process extents from the same group as if
  nothing happens, just needs to switch the tree and process only one extent
  group in one batch, the rest should build on top of the same code
