Memory allocation failure handling
==================================

* contexts
* failure modes
* recovery modes
* operational target

Raw notes
---------

restartable operations, triggered by user can fail and must fail safely with
cleaning all the intermediate and temporary structures if possible. if not,
inevitably abort.

noble goal: do not fail on any enomem for the internal operations if possible,
eg. alloc_path, set state bit, bio alloc
