Superblock handling for SMR
===========================

"rolling superblock"

do not overwrite the superblock in one place

write next superblock update after the last one, if the range is full, erase
and rewind.

erase and rewind is not atomic, so we need at least 2 copies of the
superblock, when one is being rotated, the other must hold the last sb version

* backward compatibility

there will be some superblock copy in the expected locations, blkid will be
albe to identify the filesystem

* mount

look for the latest superblock, highest generation number

* erase and rewind

chunk size is ~256M -> first 2 superblocks match the range
