* Desc:

Go through all chunks and zero out all unused blocks. Similar to TRIM, but
available for any type of device.

* Impl:

enhance TRIM code to accept type of the action:
- TRIM
- zero out
- pseudo random
- pattern fill, eg. something like an empty b-tree leaf

implemented as iocl because the FITRIM ioctl control structure cannot be
enhanced

possibly, add another FIZERO ioctl number that will take fstrim range but will
do zero out instead of trim

* Extensions

enhance -o discard and do zero-out instead of trim, needs to enhance option
parsing:

- discard=trim
- discard=zero
- discard=pattern1
- discard=mixed -> trim for SSD and zero out for HDD
- discard=strim -> do the secure trim, better name needed

if -o discard=trim,discard=zero, do the mixed mode and do trim if the device
supports that, otherwise zero out
