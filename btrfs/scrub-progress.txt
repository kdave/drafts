Better scrub progress
---------------------

What we know:

- size of the devices (need to know the "occupied" size, raw blockdevice size
  may be different)
- amount of raw bytes processed, per-device (from ioctl)
- 

What can be calculated:

- average throughput after some period: processed bytes delta / time
  - overall (since the start)
  - last period (say 1 minute)
- ETA, based on the above
  - the throughput decreases on spinning devices at higher offsets, so we
    should be able to somehow extrapolate instead of blindly multiplying
    initial throughput by amount of data to process

Notes:

- scrub process raw bytes, we have to multiply total size by the raid
  profiles, and account partial stripes and redundancy

UI enhancements:

- btrfs scrub status (overall)

print best guess ETA, recent throughput and overall throughput

- btrfs scrub status -d (per device)

dtto, for each device

- btrfs scrub status --fancy (progressbar)

Something like:

[====!==/                ] 23%
