Library interface to btrfs, simple
----------------------------------

Provide interface for basic btrfs functionality with ease of use as a goal.
Eg. use paths for subvolume creations, or just file descriptor, etc.

Proposed library functions:
* subvolume
  * create(char *name)
  * snapshot(char *source, char *target, bool readonly)
  * delete(char *name), delete(int fd)
  * inode_to_paths(char *path, u64 inode, char **buffer, size_t size, u64 flags)
  * various tests:
    * is btrfs filesystem
    * is subvolume
  * get or set default subvolume
  * defragment range (int fd, from, to, target hint, flags)
  * resolve inode by extent number


The string inteface will open the filesystem, retrieve desired data and close
the filedescriptors transparently.

File descriptor interface can speed this up, so there'
