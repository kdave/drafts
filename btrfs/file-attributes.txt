File attribute extensions
-------------------------

Overlap with inode-flags.txt and maybe others.

Use existing interfaces for file attributes or flags to add new semantics and features. Most of them need incompat bit and and respective on-disk format representation.

- NOSYMLINK (XFLAG) - forbid creating symlinks in that directory, now implemented only by xfs, can be generic
- NODEFRAG (XFLAG) - don't defragment the file if requested, implemented by xfs
- NOTAIL (attribute) - repurpose NOTAIL file attribute as "no inline" semantics of btrfs, as reiserfs is gone
- CASEFOLD (attribute) - implement case folding (case-insensitive directory lookup), needs update to lookup and has some quirks regarding encoding

Remaining questions are about inheritability from parent directory. More
attributes may be repurposed or used (e.g. compression).
