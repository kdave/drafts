Updates to balance progress tracking
------------------------------------

Keep global status for relocation, add a type of current user of the
relocation (balance, resize, device delete).

Add cancellation points and update status at these points. Keep track of the
current step being done. Make the stats accessible from any context, possibly
with cheap locks.

Extend progs commands to use the status information, eg. report resize status.

UI: some commands were not thought with extensibility, so we might go
inconsistent (ie no subcommand but a --option), or make hacks to make it work
in places where other param type is expected (btrfs fi resize status /path).
