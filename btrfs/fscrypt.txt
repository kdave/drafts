Random notes on fscrypt integration

- it's everywhere, callbacks etc
- many interfaces need fscrypt_prepare_OP, mostly no-op, finds out what
  needs to be done by checking IS_ENCRYPTED and passes data further

- bios are handled in a different way

- decrypt after read
- at write time, shuffling with pages, switching clear/encrypted
- touches ->private, check if/how much it interferes with current private use
