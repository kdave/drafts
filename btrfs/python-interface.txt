Python interface to the SEARCH_TREE ioctl
-----------------------------------------

As the b-trees are just the storage, all the logic behind is in the relations
of the keys and related structures. So write python code for reading the raw
data from disks and transforming them to objects representing the tree objects
would be a good start.

Then adding layer of objects that represent the relations, like "file in a
directory", "subvolume" etc would be built on top of that.

Each b-tree item has it's python object, etc.
