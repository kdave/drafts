Chunk tree mover
----------------

we can shift the whole filesystem by just recalculating the chunk tree

implementation:
- shift a partition to the left
- recalculate the chunk tree with the delta
- copy superblocks to the expected new locations
- relocate any conflicting extents with the new superblocks

The chunk tree is typically small, all can be done in memory and stored once.
The worst problem is handling the conflicts of extents and superblocks.

The first megabyte is free, so shift by less than this will be conflict-less
with any extents, but this will be a rare case.

Potential conflicts can be identified safely, the relocation of the extents
can be done safely before the system recalculation.

Normally the metadata blockgroups know if there's a superblock inside, no need
to account for that extra, just leave a hole there.

It's possible that data chunks might need splitting the chunk at the
superblock boundary, or not.

Potential ENOSPC problems, should be easy to check ahead of time.
