Userspace events
----------------

Use kobject_uevents to notify userspace about some important events to
userspace. The uevents is what udev uses so there's an established way and
easier (extra data passed a-la shell variables) than raw netlink with custom
protocol. The events are something like:

* state changes
  * filesystem size changed
  * enospc encountered
  * eio encountered
  * subvolume created, deleted, cleaned
  * transaction aborted, filesystem readonly
* device events
  * add device
  * delete device
  * replace device
  meta: maybe started, stopped
* whole filesystem jobs
  * scrub started, stopped, cancelled
  * balance started, stopped, cancelled
  * resized
* recovery actions
  * checksum mismatch detected, and repaired
  * checksum mismatch detected

The environment of the event would contain filesystem UUID, subvolume, path to
file, device id, etc where applicable.


Transport
---------

Define set of variables that are global, common per-group of events and
per-event


Protocol
--------

Define values for the variables. Define the events.
