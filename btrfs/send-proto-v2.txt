Send stream protocol bump (to v2)
=================================

Protocol change requests
------------------------

Missing from v1:

* send extent holes in files efficiently, use hole punching (was not available during v1 time)
* send preallocated extents properly
* extent clones within one file
* send otime for inodes
* send file flags
  * (FS_IOC_GETFLAGS/FS_IOC_SETFLAGS), the receiving side misses NOCOW and the
    other attributes like append-only, immutable etc.
  * setting the flags on receiving side is tricky as the flags affects if/how the data are stored
* optionally send owner/group as strings

Other:

stream version recognition
extend ioctl to produce v1 or v2 formats

Userspace changes
-----------------

* verify that all callbacks supported by the format are defined [independent]

* new commandline options to specify format version

$ btrfs send --stream-version 2 /path

define maximum, minimum, report supported, query supported

* set the protocol version in the ioctl(SEND) request

* API changes

bump libbtrfs minor version, the send callback structure has changed

Kernel changes
--------------

* extend ioctl flags with protocol version
* make protocol mismatch more verbose and user friendly, currently it's just
  EINVAL

* extend protocol command defintions (patches exist)

* implement new commands (patches exist)
