Dumping ground for anything, no details. Some prototypes exist. Incomplete
list.

# Kernel

## Core

- finish conversions to xarray, the API provides preallocation and safe locked
  checks for presence of the empty item or racing insert
- add tracepoints for heuristic
- uevents
- transaction context to replace GFP_NOFS
- background readahead
- tree checker enhancements
- iomap
- snapshot aware defrag again
- configurable allocators
- emergency decompression buffer
- subvolume level encryption
- per subvolume raid levels
- autodefrag to its own threads
- assertions for setget helpers
- extended debugging (ioctl, sysfs, bpf)
- faster key in node/leaf search, cache friendly, optimize jumps
- remove async commit (ioctl and related functionality)
- cache for all scrub pages
- error handling and BUG_ON removal
- recursive snapshots
- swapfile based on direct io
- own page for superblock writing (no pagecache)
- backref cycle verification
- more assertions in async callbacks or deep callstacks
- error handling of impossible ASSERT(0) (wire to shutdown)
- reduce GFP_ATOMIC if not needed
- (done) cgroup integrations
- (done) io_uring integrations, find what's still missing
- (done for metadata) subpage finish
- (no, discontinued upstream) DAX
- (no, superseded by rst) write intent bitmap for raid56
- (done) fs_context conversion
- (no, API hard to use right, questionable benefits, removed) asynchronous
  checksumming (API change or switch on demand)
- (done) realtime zstd levels

## Fixes

- fix heuristic, running 2x
- seeding remount bug, snapshot deletion
- seeding writable device tracking

## Optimizations

- struct member redundancy (bbio)
- struct size optimizations, hole removal, access pattern

## Cleanups, refactoring

- named allocations from generic slabs, sysfs stats
- reduce RCU string usage, possibly remove
- refactor extent_io_tree, simple range+status tracking
- bios
- int type unifications, remove size_t other than interfaces, pgoff_t for page
  index, u64 otherwise
- naming unification, prefixes
- drop simple helpers unless providing a value
- static inline misuse
- noinline review and removal
- __pure or __const attributes, review, add
- __cold attribures
- unlikely annotations for impossible branches
- int / bool misuse
- for () inline declarations
- ret, ret2, err unification
- btrfs_path autofree, add more
- ASSERT, verbose
- factor out if (zoned) and other to helpers
- inode and btrfs_inode conversions
- reconsider WARN_ON, replace with DEBUG_WARN
- named enums, replace int
- (continued) redundant parameter removal
- (continued) use helpers where not done yet (list, rb, ...)
- (continued) parameter constifications (our, other API)
- (continued) reduce arguments, sink constants
- (continued) standalone includes
- (continued) iwyu, use LSP with editor
- (almost done) get rid of indirect function calls
- (done in 6.10, watch) reduce btrfs_inode size, get size under 1024 in
  maximal config

## UI

- configurable message ids
- synthetic properties and flag representation
- sysfs updates
- per transaction mount options
- per subvolume mount options (remount is the problem, revisit after new mount
  API)
- properties for all flags
- (done) async discard by default
- (done) enhance compression error messages

## Features

- authenticated hashes, v3
- one checksum for the whole filesystem, subvolume
- metadata_ratio review
- ioctl scrub to track status in kernel, in persistent items
- ioctl for block based deduplication (memory only)
- ioctl defrag with more compression options (levels, none, sticky)
- ioctl metadata preallocation
- ioctl metadata readahead
- ioctl cube search (not linear space like search)
- ioctl start/wait sync rework, drop async commit
- ioctl search with ioctl to node header
- ioctl send v3 and beyond
- ioctl shutdown, wire to eb member out of bounds access, checkpoints
- (wip) ioctl clear free space
- (wip) ioctl scrub a given subvolume
- (wip) background autobalance
- (done) ioctl scrub (Qu)
- (done, experimental) raid1* load balancing, test and verify algorithms,
  promote to default the best one (rr)

## Feature removals

- free space cache v1, schedule to 7.0
