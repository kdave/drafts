Send stream abuse
-----------------

Send stram is just a sequence of instructions to modify a file. This can be
crafted to the extent that it can transfer just file/directory changes without
the need for the received subvolume that’s required for normal receive.

Probably would work only for some send items and might wreak havoc to the
existing files (ie. unexpected to the user, otherwise would be a valid
filesystem data).
