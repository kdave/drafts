dangerous repair, forced fsck
-----------------------------

Add options to fsck to run on a mounted filesystem, regardless if it’s RO 

33 Related to that:
34
35 There are other, dangerous, scenarios where it would be desired to
36 override the exclusive open and perform a surgery on a live filesystem.
37 This is motivated by 'xfs_repair -d', that's been mentioned on the list
38 in the past. The usecases I see:
39
40 * run RO fsck on a mounted and hopefully quiescent filesystem
41   the risk is that fsck will fail/crash;
42   also, it's useful during debugging to check if the on-disk state is
43   consistent after a crash if the machine is still usable
44 * run RW/repair fsck on a mounted filesystem, aka the dangerous mode of
45   xfs_repair:
46     "Allow xfs_repair to repair an XFS filesystem mounted read only.
47     This is typically done on a root filesystem from single user mode,
48     immediately followed by a reboot."

51 So, all of that should be covered by a --force option


Lift the check_mounted in btrfs-check, allow to proceed.

* read-only check

no checks of the mount, ro is easy, rw should crash check if there are changes
on disk inconsistent with previous state that checker would see

* dangerous repair

allow ‘btrfs check --repair` on a mounted filesytem, see usecase above (and good luck)
